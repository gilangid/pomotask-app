What is Pomotask?

A personal project called Pomotask offers a customisable pomodoro timer that functions in both desktop and mobile browsers. This app is designed to help you concentrate on any task you are working on, including writing, studying, and coding. The Pomodoro Technique, a time management strategy created by Francesco Cirillo, served as the model for this app.
